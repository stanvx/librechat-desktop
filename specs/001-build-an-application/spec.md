# Feature Specification: LibreChat Desktop Application

**Feature Branch**: `001-build-an-application`  
**Created**: 2025-01-21  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "build an application that will wrap LibreChat web ui endpoints within a local crossplatform application prioritising MacOS and native features. Things like multiwindow, hotekeys for new chats, file menus, shares, screenshots and files more directly into the app, plus any other useful features web apps brought into desktop. Consider we don't have any influence over the web service itself as it's maintained seperately. Things should be fast and small pacakage sizes which is why I'm thinking about Tauri v2 as the platform. System Tray Integration  quick access to conversations, start new chats, or paste from clipboard directly. Global Hotkeys  summon LibreChat from anywhere (like Spotlight or Raycast). Quick Capture Overlay  a floating mini-window for jotting notes, asking fast questions, or AI-powered clipboard summarization. Drag & Drop Support  drop in files, screenshots, or text snippets from the OS for instant analysis. Offline Caching  retain recent conversations and knowledge locally when offline. other ideas... Tabbed Interface  like a browser, each chat in its own tab. Split View  compare two conversations side-by-side. Pin & Star Chats  keep critical threads at the top. Rich Preview Pane  inline previews for code outputs, images, tables, or charts. Docking Mode  keep a slim chat dock pinned to the side of the screen for quick context."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A LibreChat user wants to integrate AI conversations seamlessly into their daily desktop workflow. Instead of keeping a browser tab open, they need a native desktop application that provides quick access to AI assistance from anywhere on their system, supports rich file interactions, maintains conversation context, and offers productivity features that enhance their AI-powered work.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** the desktop application is installed, **When** a user presses a global hotkey combination, **Then** the application appears instantly with a new chat interface ready for input

2. **Given** a user has an active conversation, **When** they drag and drop a file from their desktop onto the chat interface, **Then** the file is automatically uploaded and analyzed by LibreChat with results displayed inline

3. **Given** a user is working in another application, **When** they activate the quick capture overlay, **Then** a small floating window appears where they can type a quick question and receive an immediate AI response without switching contexts

4. **Given** a user has multiple conversations active, **When** they use the tabbed interface, **Then** they can switch between different AI conversations just like browser tabs, with each maintaining its context

5. **Given** a user needs to compare two AI responses, **When** they activate split view mode, **Then** two conversation panes appear side-by-side for direct comparison

6. **Given** the user loses internet connectivity, **When** they open recent conversations, **Then** they can view previously cached conversation history and continue reading offline

7. **Given** a user frequently accesses certain conversations, **When** they pin or star important chats, **Then** these conversations remain easily accessible at the top of their conversation list

8. **Given** a user receives code, tables, or charts from LibreChat, **When** viewing the conversation, **Then** rich previews display formatted content inline without requiring external applications

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the LibreChat web service is unavailable during online operations?
- How does the system handle very large file uploads through drag and drop?
- What occurs when global hotkeys conflict with other installed applications?
- How does the application behave when system resources are limited?
- What happens to cached data when storage space runs low?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*
