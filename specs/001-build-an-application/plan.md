# Implementation Plan: LibreChat Desktop Application

**Branch**: `001-build-an-application` | **Date**: 2025-01-21 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/Users/trentstanton/Dev/librechat-desktop/specs/001-build-an-application/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)
```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detect Project Type from context (web=frontend+backend, mobile=app+api)
   → Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Fill the Constitution Check section based on the content of the constitution document.
4. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
5. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
6. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file (e.g., `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for GitHub Copilot, `GEMINI.md` for Gemini CLI, `QWEN.md` for Qwen Code or `AGENTS.md` for opencode).
7. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
8. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
9. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:
- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

**Scale/Scope**: Single-user desktop application, ~20 core features, cross-platform compatibility

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

**Pre-Development Gate**:
- ✅ Requirements clearly defined: 36 functional requirements in spec.md
- ✅ Testable acceptance criteria established: 8 acceptance scenarios with Given/When/Then format
- ✅ Performance targets specified: <3s startup, <100ms UI, <200ms API, <50MB package
- ✅ Accessibility requirements documented: Rich previews, keyboard shortcuts, OS integration

**Development Gate** (validated after Phase 1):
- ✅ Tests framework defined: Contract tests for API endpoints, Unit tests (Rust/Frontend), Integration tests (Tauri)
- ✅ Code review process: TDD workflow documented in quickstart.md
- ✅ Static analysis setup: Rust clippy, ESLint/Prettier for frontend planned
- ✅ Documentation structure: research.md, data-model.md, contracts/, quickstart.md completed
- ✅ Performance budget validation: <50MB package, <3s startup, <100ms UI defined

**TDD Compliance**:
- ✅ Plan follows Red-Green-Refactor cycle: Contract tests → Implementation → Refactor
- ✅ Test types identified: Contract tests, integration tests, unit tests mandatory
- ✅ Test-first approach: Phase 1 generates failing tests before any implementation

**Quality Standards**:
- ✅ Code quality tools: Rust clippy, frontend ESLint/Prettier planned
- ✅ Performance monitoring: Tauri bundle analysis, memory/CPU monitoring
- ✅ Cross-platform validation: macOS primary, Windows/Linux secondary

**GATE STATUS**: ✅ PASS - Ready for Phase 0 research

ios/ or android/
└── [platform-specific structure]
```

**Structure Decision**: Option 1 (Single project) with Tauri-specific modifications:
- Tauri follows single project pattern with src-tauri/ for Rust backend
- Frontend assets in src/ directory
- Tauri configuration in src-tauri/tauri.conf.json

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:
   - For each NEEDS CLARIFICATION → research task
   - For each dependency → best practices task
   - For each integration → patterns task

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:
   ```
   For each unknown in Technical Context:
     Task: "Research {unknown} for {feature context}"
   For each technology choice:
     Task: "Find best practices for {tech} in {domain}"
   ```

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:
   - Decision: [what was chosen]
   - Rationale: [why chosen]
   - Alternatives considered: [what else evaluated]

**Output**: research.md with all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:
   - Entity name, fields, relationships
   - Validation rules from requirements
   - State transitions if applicable

2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:
   - For each user action → endpoint
   - Use standard REST/GraphQL patterns
   - Output OpenAPI/GraphQL schema to `/contracts/`

3. **Generate contract tests** from contracts:
   - One test file per endpoint
   - Assert request/response schemas
   - Tests must fail (no implementation yet)

4. **Extract test scenarios** from user stories:
   - Each story → integration test scenario
   - Quickstart test = story validation steps

5. **Update agent file incrementally** (O(1) operation):
   - Run `.specify/scripts/bash/update-agent-context.sh claude`
     **IMPORTANT**: Execute it exactly as specified above. Do not add or remove any arguments.
   - If exists: Add only NEW tech from current plan
   - Preserve manual additions between markers
   - Update recent changes (keep last 3)
   - Keep under 150 lines for token efficiency
   - Output to repository root

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/*, failing tests, quickstart.md, agent-specific file

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Load `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` as base
- Generate tasks from Phase 1 design docs (contracts, data model, quickstart)
- API Contract tests: 4 contract test tasks [P] (auth, conversations, messages, files)
- Data Model tasks: 8 entity creation tasks [P] (Conversation, Message, EncryptedCache, MessageQueue, UserPreferences, ServerConfiguration, DroppedFile, QuickCapture)
- User Story tests: 8 integration test tasks based on acceptance scenarios
- Core Implementation: 12-15 implementation tasks following TDD order
- Setup tasks: Project initialization, dependencies, configuration

**Ordering Strategy**:
- **Phase 2A - Setup** (Tasks 1-5): Project init, dependencies, Tauri config, dev environment
- **Phase 2B - Tests First** (Tasks 6-17): Contract tests [P], Entity tests [P], Integration test scaffolds
- **Phase 2C - Core Models** (Tasks 18-25): Data models, database schema, encryption setup [P]
- **Phase 2D - Services** (Tasks 26-32): API clients, authentication, offline storage, sync logic
- **Phase 2E - UI Core** (Tasks 33-40): Main window, authentication UI, conversation list, message display
- **Phase 2F - Desktop Features** (Tasks 41-48): System tray, global hotkeys, quick capture, file handling
- **Phase 2G - Integration** (Tasks 49-52): End-to-end tests, performance validation, bundle optimization

**Parallel Execution Opportunities**:
- Contract tests can run independently [P]
- Entity model creation tasks are parallel [P] 
- Frontend and backend development can proceed in parallel after contracts
- UI component development parallelizable after core state management

**Estimated Output**: 50-55 numbered, ordered tasks in tasks.md with clear dependency chains and parallel execution markers

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)  
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)  
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking
*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
